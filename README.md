# Kraft

With this porject, I am just trying to learn Vulkan and get into some graphics programming. The code is mediocre at best and it is what it is. I have written it in a very C-style fashion because I want it to build fast, really fast so I can iterate faster. I have worked on C++ projects and they just become too slow and that's not something I wanted for a project that I am using for learning. Also, I wanted to do as many things as I can on my own so I don't plan to use too many libraries. 

I do plan to make this good enough so I can use it as a base framework for my personal projects though.

So far the ride has been fun and I have learned a lot of things.

Here's a sneak peek -
